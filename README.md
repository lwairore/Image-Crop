# Crop Image
Cropping images is a fairly common use in a Web application. For example, some applications let you upload a profile picture. In addition, it usually also let you crop and resize the image for a better result. 

This application allows a user to upload an image, display a preview in a modal, crop the image and finally upload it and save it in the server.
